We call on the leaders and members of the Green Party, Labour Party, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, and Scottish National Party to form a progressive alliance of parties working together to avert a worst case Brexit scenario.

Working together, such an alliance must do all it can to ensure:
- Human rights in the UK are protected. This includes the rights and protections of ethnic & religious minorities and LGBTQ people.
- Workers rights in the UK are protected. This includes protection of equal pay, maternity & paternity rights, and the rights of workers to join unions.
- Environmental protections & safeguards are maintained. This includes ratifying the Paris Climate Agreement, continuing the UK's commitments to de-carbonise, and maintaining air quality & safety rules.
- The public services of the UK are not put at risk of privatisation in any trade deals made during Brexit negotiations.

As signatories we also pledge to support such a progressive alliance in a General Election, and do our best to ensure it's victory in order to deliver the above.
