We call on the leaders, elected representatives, and members of the Green Party, Labour Party, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, and Scottish National Party to form a progressive alliance of parties working together to avert a worst case 'Brexit' scenario.

Working together, such an alliance must do all it can to:
- Guarantee the right to live & work for all those currently living in the UK, both from the EU and from outside
- Protect human rights in the UK
- Protect workers rights in the UK
- Ensure environmental protections & safeguards are maintained
- Ensure that the public services of the UK are not put at risk of privatisation
- Respect other nations in any trade deals made
- Protect grant funding to agriculture, science and local communities which previously came from the EU budget

As signatories we also pledge to support such a progressive alliance in a General Election, and do our best to ensure it's victory in order to deliver the above.

What this means in practice:
- Saying no to deportating people currently residing in the UK as a result of 'Brexit'
- Maintaining gender equality legislation
- Protecting the rights of ethnic & religious minorities
- Protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ people
- Protecting equal pay
- Protecting maternity & paternity rights
- Protecting the rights of workers to join unions, and the rights of unions
- Ratifying the Paris Climate Agreement
- Continuing the UK's commitments to de-carbonise
- Maintaining air quality & safety rules
- Blocking trade deals which would erode the right or ability to provide public services in the UK
- Blocking trade deals which would erode the human rights and / or workers rights of the populations of other countries
- Working to ensure communities are not left worse off due to withdrawal of EU funding after 'Brexit'
