We call on the leaders, elected representatives, and members of the Green Party, Labour Party, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, and Scottish National Party to form a progressive alliance of parties working together to avert a worst case Brexit scenario.

Working together, such an alliance must do all it can to:
- Guarantee the right to live & work for all those currently living in the UK, both from the EU and from outside. No deportations.
- Protect human rights in the UK. This includes maintaining gender equality legislation and protecting the rights of ethnic & religious minorities and LGBTQ people.
- Protect workers rights in the UK. This includes protection of equal pay, maternity & paternity rights, and the rights of workers to join unions.
- Ensure environmental protections & safeguards are maintained. This includes ratifying the Paris Climate Agreement, continuing the UK's commitments to de-carbonise, and maintaining air quality & safety rules.
- Ensure that the public services of the UK are not put at risk of privatisation in any trade deals made during Brexit negotiations.
- Respect other nations in any trade deals meade - particularly the human rights & workers rights of the populations of those countries.
- Protect regional funding previously allocated by the EU to ensure that various, mainly poorer, areas of the UK are not left worse-off as a result of Brexit.

As signatories we also pledge to support such a progressive alliance in a General Election, and do our best to ensure it's victory in order to deliver the above.
