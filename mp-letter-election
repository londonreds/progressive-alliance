Following the EU Referundum and the vote for the United Kingdom to leave the EU, I am concerned that no government has a mandate for what type of relationship we should have with the EU after the UK leaves. For example, should the UK remain part of the EEA? Should freedom of movement be curbed? Should EU nationals already living in the UK have a guaranteed right to remain? What laws should replace EU laws on workers rights, equality, and the environment?

None of these questions were answered by the EU Referendum debate - and often different advocates of the Leave campaign gave contradictory statements. As such, no political party has a mandate for how we go about leaving the EU. I believe we must have a General Election before Article 50 is invoked so that these issues can be debated and both those wishing to leave and remain can have their say on the terms of our exit.

Leaving the EU will represent a huge change in our relationship with our closest neighbours, and in the laws that govern our own country. As such I respectfully but strongly urge you vote against invoking Article 50 until the public have had their say in a General Election.
