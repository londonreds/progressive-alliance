Progressive Alliance of the UK

=== What is it? ===
A call for people to come together and work to eliminate the worst-case Brexit scenario - not just an erosion of human rights, workers rights, and environmental protections, but a veritable bonfire of them.
We need support from members of the public, and all of those involved with progressive political parties.

=== What's the plan? ===
1 - Build support and make connections with others in the UK who support a progressive alliance to fight for our rights and protections in a post-Brexit world.
2 - Lobby the progressive political parties to come together to form a progressive alliance to this end
3 - Push for a General Election before any Brexit negotiations begin - no party has a manifesto for what a post-Brexit UK looks like, and as such the Conservatives have no mandate to start Brexit negotiations
4 - Lobby all parties, including the Conservatives, to protect our rights and protections (ie. contingency planning)

=== What can I do? ===
1 - Join this group, share it, discuss, get involved. We need you.
2 - Sign the petition / pledge! The more signatures we have, the more we can show political parties who have long been adversaries that this is workable and our best chance of avoiding a nightmare Brexit scenario.
3 - If you live in an area with an MP belonging to a progressive party, then write to them and ask them to sign the pledge & support an early General Election! If you get a response, please let us know so we can share! https://www.writetothem.com/
4 - If you live in an area with an MP belonging to a non-progressive party, you can still write to them and ask them to pledge to keep EU human rights, workers rights, and environmental protections, as well as supporting an early General Election. https://www.writetothem.com/


=== TODO list: ===
- Create the pledge (InProgress)
- Create a petition for people to sign
- Create templates for writing to your progressive MP
- Create templates for writing to your non-progressive MP

I am not, nor have I ever been a member of any political party, although I have seriously considered joining the Greens before, and may well be doing so imminently...
