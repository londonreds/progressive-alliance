Following the advisory referendum on the UK's membership of the EU, approximately 52% of the electorate voted to leave the EU. However, this alone does not give any political party or government the mandate to negotiate the UK's exit from the EU. The referendum was purely a question about the UK's continuing membership of the EU - it did not indicate what sort of relationship the UK should have with the EU in the event of Leaving, nor did it spell out how the UK should go about replacing the various EU laws which will cease to take effect when the UK leaves. Indeed, different advocates of leaving the EU often presented differing visions of what the UK would look like outside the EU.

As such, we call upon Parliament to debate a motion of no confidence in the Government prior to Article 50 being triggered. All political parties must have a chance to put forward their vision & negotiating position for the UK outside of the EU, such that members of the public can have a say on the type of 'Brexit' in a General Election. This will provide the winning party with a democratic mandate for negotiations with the EU and individual nations, and any new UK laws to replace EU laws.
